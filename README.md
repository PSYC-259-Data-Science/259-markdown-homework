Homework 5 - R Markdown 

PSYC 259: Principles of Data Science 

Instructor: John Franchak 

## Objective 

Convert a heavily-commented R script into a more-nicely formatted (and still functional) R Markdown report. In the folder, you will find `group_exercise.R`, which contains my answer key for the EDA exercise we did a few weeks ago. I made lots of comments about the data structure, wrote code and comments for the data cleaning/merging, and I also provided the answers for how to do a few EDA things (steps 3A and 3B). I have included an example of *roughly* what the final report should look like called `eda_markdown.html`. 

## Steps 

1. In R Studio, create a new R Markdown document that will output to html.
2. Copy the comments and code over from `group_exercise.R` to your new R Markdown file. Turn the text into markdown prose, and put the code into code chunks. Look at the example document to see whether code/results should be shown vs. hidden. 
3. Do this a little bit at a time and periodically knit your document to make sure it's working correctly. 
4. Turn in the final project on Github or RStudio Cloud.
